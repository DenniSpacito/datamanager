# datamanager
First python project. Allows you to graph basic data. 

# commands:

guess() Takes no arguments, instead inputted by the user. You will be prompted to enter labels, x, and y values.

summarize() Takes no arguments, instead inputted by the user. You will be prompted to enter data values, and you will recieve the mean, median, and mode of the dataset.

# Why?

This is something that realistically already exists and works, however I wanted to progress in my computer science journey by making my first python and general computer science project. It didn't take very long, but I learned a lot throughout it. My next goal is to learn more about git, python, and TKinter, to make a budgeting program. Thanks for reading :)

# Future?

I plan to update this with a bit more features, better CLI using argparse, and maybe a bit more!
